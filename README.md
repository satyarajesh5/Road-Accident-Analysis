# Road Accident Analysis (2021-2022) - My First Ever Excel Dashboard

## Project Overview

This is **my first ever data dashboard**, where I analyzed road accident trends for the years 2021 and 2022 using Excel. The project helped me develop data visualization and analysis skills by identifying key patterns related to accident severity, road conditions, weather effects, and vehicle types.

Dataset Information

Timeframe: 2021-2022

Total Records:307974

**Key Fields:**

1. Accident Severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)

2. Date & Time of Accidents

3. Weather & Road Conditions

4. Vehicle Types Involved

5. Speed Limits and Urban/Rural Classification

**Dashboard Features**
